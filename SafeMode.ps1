# 
# An exploratory tool for analyzing the service and driver dependencies of safeboot/safe mode. 
# The script will export running driver and service information in each state then compared. 
# This can be used to create a simlar operating state while booted normally, useful for troubleshooting 
# or to reduce the time to create a minimal build/installation using safemode  configuration state as 
# the baseline. The running system could be refined further with additional research. Disabling specific
# services or drivers can impact performance or normal operation, make incremental changes and test the impacts.
#
# Other operating state changes may also occur as part of booting into safe mode, this does not 
# capture all environmental state changes just drivers and services.

#
# 1. Download the script and place it in it's own folder .\Desktop\SafeMode\SafeMode.ps1
# 2. Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
# 3. Boot into safe mode and change directories to the folder you created earlier.
# 4. Run the command .\SafeMode.ps1 -Guided
# 5. Once it has run successfully and collected the necessary data boot into normal mode.
# 6. Run the command again (.\SafeMode.ps1 -Guided ) to collect the regular operational state data.
# 7. You will be prompted to disable related services which were present in the operating state but not
#    the safeboot operational state, if you choose n (no) you can review the operating state differences 
#    afterwards which have been exported to files. Once you have had time to review the changes and have
#    determined which services you'd like to disable run the scrip again to continue.
#
#    Note: If a driver/service isn't detected during the primary operational state it does not mean they 
#          won't be needed in the future by another service such as dependent of or dependencies.
#          Pay close attention to drivers start up type (boot, system, manual, automatic), depended on and
#          dependencies presented during the disabling services process.
#
#    SafeModeBaseServices.txt - A list of dependent services, drivers and driver groups (Base, File System, 
#                               and NDIS) required for safeboot with networking.
#
#                               HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Network
#
#    NonSafeBootRunningServices.txt - A list of services running in normal mode that were not at the 
#                                     time of safemode data capture.
#
#    DisabledSvcActivityLog.txt - A text file created as part of the disabling services process, it logs the
#                                 date/time, the action outcome, and the previous start up type of the modified
#                                 driver and service for future reference (e.g. Manual, System, Automatic)
